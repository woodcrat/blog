This is the final weekly meeting before presenting, however we plan on meeting both Friday as well as Monday before presenting to finalise any details and ensure our presentation is ready. The game is very close to being finished despite setbacks faced. The game as a whole is functional, however there are still a couple of bugs identified through testing that need to be ironed out. The team have identified what it is that needs to be changed and are currently working on a fix. There’s still plenty of time for this and so we are confident the deadline will still be met. This does unfortunately mean that the rocket features and any animation or additional audio aren’t going to be implemented in time for the project. Whilst it may have been possible to squeeze it in, the team have decided it’s not a risk worth taking as there isn’t time to test and ensure any new functionality is full working at this late stage. The team are going to be working on creating the presentation, ready to be practised and rehearsed ready for Monday. We plan on taking a short break following the demonstration, however will be back to start on the report shortly afterwards.
