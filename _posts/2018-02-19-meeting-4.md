With a month to go, the teams have really been hard at work. We’ve made some significant progress over the last week and so today’s meeting was quite brief, more of a ‘check in’ with one another just to make sure we’re on the right path. Other than that, the teams have gone away to continue their work. Communication continues via WhatsApp if we have any queries/issues/clarifications between our weekly meetings.

We’ve successfully got the board of the game down. We have 3d cubes that can be rendered in, representing each teams board. The way in which the background and water are going to be implemented have been finalised, it’s currently being developed on a separate branch to be added in later. The ships are also beginning to look like ships, with the initial designs of the ship components being created, again separately ready to be added once complete. Progress is also being made with the game logic, however a couple of setbacks and adaption issues between libraries have meant that it may take slightly longer than originally expected, although we will continue to work on this. As for audio, we have some clips that we have permission to use for the menus so they are currently on standby – the actual menu screens are now being developed ready for the audio!
