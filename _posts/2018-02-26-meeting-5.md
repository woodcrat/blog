With 3 weeks to go until the deadline, things are looking good. The background is done, the basic water element is done – it’s moving! We’re currently working on improving it, making it smoother and realistic as we feel this will really bring out the final product. The ships have been created and are almost implemented, there’s just a few bugs and issues with placements and implementing them alongside the board – this should be sorted by next weeks meeting. The game is good and almost functional. It works, we just need to produce a smooth way for the game to be opened and for the user to easily interact with the game, for the different endpoints to be handled. There are still bugs but these are being worked on, we are aware of what’s causing them and are just working on a workaround. A rocket has also been produced with its own custom arching motion that takes input and output coordinates. We’ll look to implement this over the next week.
