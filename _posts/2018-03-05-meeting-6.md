Things are beginning to look slightly tight in terms of time but the team is confident we will still be able to fit everything in. This week the team are focusing on user testing... We’re getting as many friends, family members and peers as possible to play the game. The idea of this is to identify any flaws we may have overlooked or bugs that can be found at runtime. We’ve also decided it’s invaluable to get these tests done to ensure that the game is as usable and user-friendly as we think it is – it’s hard to be sure of this being so close to the development of the game. Overall, perhaps most importantly we want to make sure that the requirements of the game and the project have been met and that the game is a success and provides a pleasant experience for the user.
