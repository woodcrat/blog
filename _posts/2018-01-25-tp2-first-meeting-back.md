This was the first meeting back since the start of teaching period 2. We discussed where we were with the project and the different ideas and directions we wanted to take the project during the next stage of development.

We had previously had the idea that the target audience would be focused on “everyone”, however after having a review meeting and discussing amongst ourselves, we decided that this simply wasn’t practical. We needed to give the game a more specific target audience to enable ourselves to tailor the game for them – certain things simply wouldn’t make sense otherwise. For example, having lots of complex features wouldn’t make sense for much younger players, they would need more of an intuitive and basic guide for beginners.
Another discussion topic was key features to add. The main basis of this was discussing any ideas we had for what we could implement into the game next. This involved the potential for having two players perhaps using sockets or developing the ships so that they had individual perks such as a larger shot distance that takes more goes etc. However, after the preliminary discussion we decided that whilst it was worth noting these ideas, we would save any concrete commitments to after we had developed the base of the game and got a feel for what we felt was realistic and obtainable.

We also talked about the graphics of the game and how we would like to progress the game from 2D to 3D, giving the game more depth and making it more exciting. After all, a 3D display has much more to offer aesthetically that that of a 2D display.
There was also a discussion on animation, so the idea being that we could implement “mini cut-scenes” into the game for key events. So for things such as when a player misses, they get a hit, and also when a ship is sunk. This was mainly just to establish what the animations needed to be of, rather than any specifics or implementation detail at this stage. This has been left to discuss later by the team members working on the animation, to report back in future weeks.

Another simple yet experience enhancing feature was the sound for the game. We want to get some sort of background music to be playing in the game, as well as sounds for firing and missing  for when the relevant action occurs.

Finally, to sum up this meeting as we’d covered pretty much all of the big topic areas we wanted to, was for each of us to pick something we were going to work on or research for the first week, in order to  ensure the constant development of the project and make sure we were working towards our goals.
