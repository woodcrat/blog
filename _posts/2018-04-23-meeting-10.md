The report is due Friday so we decided to meet one final time today to make sure that everything was ready. We read over the report as a group, identifying any errors or inconsistencies that we felt there were and adjusted them so that all group members were happy with how it read. It also gave us the opportunity to ‘check off’ all of the contents we wanted to include, to make sure that nothing was missing. This proved to be successful and following our meeting, we now feel that we have a finished report, ready for submission on Friday.
