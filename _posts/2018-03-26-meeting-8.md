The demonstration was successful! Following a week off to focus on other work and give ourselves a break, today we met up to discuss beginning our group project. We gained some valuable feedback from our overall positive demonstration session. The session itself ran smoothly which was very positive. The only thing that was perhaps overlooked was that we should’ve completed unit testing on the code itself, as well as our unit testing. This is definitely an idea we’ve decided we want to note as an improvement in the report. Today we discussed what we felt should go into the report, in an attempt to get the basics down whilst our memories were still fresh. We split into 4 groups, each with two members and a range of topics to cover each. We decided at this stage that this would be sufficient and for now we would each go away and try to work on what we would include in greater detail.
