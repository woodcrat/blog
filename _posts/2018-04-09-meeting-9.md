Today we met to confer and finalise the content we would include in the report and who would do what. This was to make sure that any overlaps between sections were addressed, to try and avoid repetition where possible.  With a few weeks to go we decided to work on a first draft where we would each write our own sections before knitting them together. We’re going to work on this over the next two weeks, communicating via WhatsApp. The aim is that we will meet again on the Monday before the report is due to finalise and make any edits we need to. It’s worth noting that we’re using Google Drive to create the document to allow us to work together without having to be in the same place. We also intend to use voice chat services such as Discord in order to quick flash meetings to monitor progress and make sure everyone is okay and clear with what they are doing.
